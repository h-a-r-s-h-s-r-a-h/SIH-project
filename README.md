- Employs Mongoose, an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library, to interact with MongoDB, defining data schemas and performing database operations.
- Provides scalability and flexibility for handling large datasets.

**EJS (Embedded JavaScript templates):**
- Integrates with Node.js to dynamically generate HTML content on the server-side.
- Allows embedding JavaScript code within HTML templates, making it easy to render dynamic content such as market data, wool listings, and user profiles.
- Promotes code reusability through template partials for common page elements like headers and footers.

**HTML, CSS, JavaScript:**
- HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is used for structuring the web pages, defining the layout, and creating forms for user interactions.
- CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is employed for styling the website, ensuring a visually appealing and consistent design.
- JavaScript enhances user interactivity, such as form validation, real-time updates, and client-side data manipulation.
- JavaScript is also used for frontend framework integration, enabling the creation of single-page applications (SPAs) or dynamic components.

**Express.js:**
- A web application framework for Node.js that simplifies the process of building web applications.
- Handles routing, middleware management, and HTTP request/response processing.
- Enables the creation of RESTful APIs for various features like user registration, login, and data retrieval.
